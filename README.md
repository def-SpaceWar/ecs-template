# TODO

- *DONE* Add scene system! (going to be a bit complicated gl future me!)
- Collision tags so same collision tags won't collide with eachother, AND only 1 per entity.
    - Entity with none is assumed unique.
- "requireComponent" for behaviors and components
- Trigger colliders (they dont cause any displacement, and only activate on COLLIDERS, not other triggers)
- Images, and circle collider.
- UI Elements that interact with mouse (Input.mouseX, Input.mouseY, Input.isMouseDown, Input.isMouseUp) support + Buttons

# FUTURE

- WASM (probably Rust) for the pure math (collisions, intensive vector math)
